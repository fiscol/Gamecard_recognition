# Gamecard_recognition
Developed by [Fiscol Wu](https://github.com/fiscol).

## Description
This project is cooperated with a board game supplier in Taiwan.

We aimed to develop a iPad required board game, using its back-side camera and our SWIFT3 based algorithm library to **recognize the number cards with specific background in real-time.**

Our clients recommended us **not to develop with OpenCV library.**

## Demo
